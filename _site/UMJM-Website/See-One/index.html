We seek to support students’ scholarship, innovation, and critical literacy in medicine. The UMJM welcomes submissions ranging from original research and review articles to commentaries, opinion pieces, and biographies. Overall, we strive to provide students with the opportunity to foster skills in academic writing and publish on emerging topics in medicine. In doing so, the UMJM may serve as a tool for learning as well as discussion for important topics relevant to our readership.                   Author Eligibility:               We welcome submissions from all students in the University of Manitoba Rady Faculty of Health Sciences as well as from external authors. This includes but is not limited to students and faculty from medical schools other than the Max Rady College of Medicine. Preference is given to student authors.                   Article Eligibility:               All submissions to the UMJM should be original works that have not been previously published or under consideration for publication in another journal. Manuscripts should be written for a general medical audience and reference using Vancouver style. Submissions should be coherent, well-written, and use proper mechanics. Where applicable, articles must use appropriate methodology, demonstrate scientific rigour, and adhere to proper ethical conduct.             Format:       The UMJM accepts articles in the following formats:               Original research (full-length or research letters/interim reports)        Reviews (narrative, literature, systematic        Case/clinical reports        Perspective pieces/commentaries/essays        Interviews        Opinion pieces, “news and views”, etc.         Letter to the editor        Medical book reviews        Medical biography            If you have an idea for a piece in a format other than those listed above, we would be happy to consider it. Please e-mail the Co-Editors in Chief at umjmed@gmail. com with your idea and they will get back to you.

These include but are not limited to:               Medical science        Clinical or surgical medicine        Epidemiology        Social determinants of health        Global health        Technology in medicine            The UMJM also accepts manuscripts that examine themes topical and/or relevant to medical students. These include but are not limited to:               COVID-19        Medical education        Historical analysis/history of medicine        Medical ethics/philosophy        Sociology of medicine        Medical humanities        Narrative medicine                  Ethics:               The UMJM adheres to  Ethical Considerations in the Conduct and Reporting of Research  set forth by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors where applicable:             Informed Consent:               Patients have a right to privacy that should not be violated without informed consent. Identifying information, including names, initials, or hospital numbers, should not be published in written descriptions, photographs, or pedigrees unless the information is essential for scientific purposes and the patient (or parent or guardian) gives written informed consent for publication. Informed consent for this purpose requires that an identifiable patient be shown the manuscript to be published. Authors should disclose to these patients whether any potential identifiable material might be available via the Internet as well as in print after publication.                     Nonessential identifying details should be omitted. Informed consent should be obtained if there is any doubt that anonymity can be maintained. For example, masking the eye region in photographs of patients is inadequate protection of anonymity. If identifying characteristics are altered to protect anonymity, such as in genetic pedigrees, authors should provide assurance, and editors should so note, that such alterations do not distort scientific meaning.                     When informed consent has been obtained, it should be indicated in the published article.             Conflict of Interest:               When authors submit a manuscript, whether an article or a letter, they are responsible for disclosing all financial and personal relationships that might bias their work. To prevent ambiguity, authors must state explicitly whether potential conflicts do or do not exist. Authors should do so in the manuscript on a conflict-of-interest notification page that follows the title page, providing additional detail, if necessary, in a cover letter that accompanies the manuscript.                     Authors should identify Individuals who provide writing or other assistance and disclose the funding source for this assistance.

Over the past 20 years, the College of Family Physicians of Canada (CFPC) has strived to improve access to health care for rural Canadians through increased development of rural residency training programs. Rural training for residents and undergraduate medical students has been shown to increase the likelihood that students and/or residents choose to practice in rural areas. Since 2011, all Manitoba regional health authorities have had ruralFamily Medicine residency programs offered through the University of Manitoba, with the exception of the Interlake-Eastern Regional Health Authority (IERHA). In July 2019, the IERHA accepted its first cohort of rural Family Medicine residents. Through an interview with the Interlake Eastern Family Medicine program director, Dr. Ian Alexander, and a brief review of the history of rural Family Medicine residency programs, this paper examines how a rural residency program may impact the healthcare in the IERHA.

A 2014 Canadian survey polled students at the Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine, and discovered that 89% of students had previous research experience. While student research participation may vary from school to school, perceived barriers to student involvement in research persist. These often include a lack of time, unfamiliarity with the research process and absence of knowledge related to seeking research opportunities. This commentary will discuss what research in pre-clerkship can look like, tips on the research process, the importance of research for medical students, and how to boost student involvement in research.

In Ontario, the College of Physicians and Surgeons (CPSO) has decided that physicians with a conscience-based objection to MAID must provide an “effective referral” for any patient who requests one. In the recent case of CMDS v CPSO, the Christian Medical and Dental Society challenged this policy, arguing that it violates their members’ rights to freedom of religion and equality. The court dismissed the constitutional challenge, holding that although the policy did infringe freedom of religion, it was justified because of the need to ensure equitable access to healthcare.

Having already transformed the business world, AI may be poised to transform healthcare next. Current AI systems demonstrate impressive competency in certain tasks of clinical medicine. Machine learning approaches to creating AI are of particular relevance in healthcare, given the ability of modern machine learning algorithms to work with large amounts of complex data and generate intelligent predictions therefrom. Here we propose that much of what physicians do can be modelled as information processing and thus can be performed by AI. We further propose that whereas certain AI systems may adopt approaches based on novel pattern extraction and interpretation, and thus diverge from human physician cognition, AI is well-positioned to assist physicians by operating in parallel alongside them. Navigating the intersection of physician and AI competence will be a tremendous and complex challenge, but may return high rewards in improving patient outcomes and lead to transformative gains in medical knowledge. Advances in AI will have tremendous and complex impact on the future of medicine.

However, the criminal code provisions relating to MAID remain quite restrictive. A minor cannot ever legally access MAID regardless of their individual maturity or personal circumstances. In this brief article, I review the constitutionality of this restriction in light of the Supreme Court’s prior decision in AC v Manitoba (Director of Child and Family Services). In that case, the Court recognized the importance of an individualized approachwhen assessing the capacity of minors to refuse life-saving medical treatment. I argue that the Court’s approach in AC is in significant tension with the categorical restriction on MAID for even the most mature minors. I conclude by briefly reviewing some countervailing considerations, which remain to be addressed by Parliament and the courts going forward.
