            <p>
                The University of Manitoba Journal of Medicine (UMJM) is a student-run, peer-reviewed medical journal. We seek to support students’ scholarship, innovation, and critical literacy in medicine. The UMJM welcomes submissions ranging from original research and review articles to commentaries, opinion pieces, and biographies. Overall, we strive to provide students with the opportunity to foster skills in academic writing and publish on emerging topics in medicine. In doing so, the UMJM may serve as a tool for learning as well as discussion for important topics relevant to our readership.

            <h2><span>Ethics</span></h2>
            <p>
            The UMJM adheres to "Ethical Considerations in the Conduct and Reporting of Research" set forth by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors where applicable:
            </p>
            <h4><span>Informed Consent</span></h4>
            <p>
                Patients have a right to privacy that should not be violated without informed consent. Identifying information, including names, initials, or hospital numbers, should not be published in written descriptions, photographs, or pedigrees unless the information is essential for scientific purposes and the patient (or parent or guardian) gives written informed consent for publication. Informed consent for this purpose requires that an identifiable patient be shown the manuscript to be published. Authors should disclose to these patients whether any potential identifiable material might be available via the Internet as well as in print after publication.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nonessential identifying details should be omitted. Informed consent should be obtained if there is any doubt that anonymity can be maintained. For example, masking the eye region in photographs of patients is inadequate protection of anonymity. If identifying characteristics are altered to protect anonymity, such as in genetic pedigrees, authors should provide assurance, and editors should so note, that such alterations do not distort scientific meaning.
