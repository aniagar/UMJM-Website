            <p>
                The University of Manitoba Journal of Medicine (UMJM) is a student-run, peer-reviewed medical journal. We seek to support students’ scholarship, innovation, and critical literacy in medicine. The UMJM welcomes submissions ranging from original research and review articles to commentaries, opinion pieces, and biographies. Overall, we strive to provide students with the opportunity to foster skills in academic writing and publish on emerging topics in medicine. In doing so, the UMJM may serve as a tool for learning as well as discussion for important topics relevant to our readership.
